The **GCP Car App** is a car buying and selling mobile application built using **Flutter**.  
This project is created **only for study purposes** to help understand Flutter development, Firebase Firestore integration, responsive UI design, and third-party package usage.

## üìñ Project Description

This application allows an **Admin** to add car details including images, model names, and pricing.  
**Users** can then browse these car listings, mark them as favorites, and simulate a buying action.

The **future vision** is to allow **any user** to attach basic car information and images, and the app will automatically generate a **beautiful and budget-friendly listing** using data processing.  
All data is stored permanently using **Firebase Firestore**.
